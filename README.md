# TextSplitter

JavaScript code which divides a provided string into seperate chunks and exports it as object. This approach was combined with
free GSAP - Green Sock animation library and [TextPlugin](https://greensock.com/TextPlugin) to make typing animation.
There is non-free plugin [SplitText](https://greensock.com/SplitText) from GSAP which have tones more features than just spliting
a text. However, if you just want a cheap way around by having this effect than you can use my approach. This code was used
together with VueJs and not tested to work as standalone without ES6 compiler.

## Demo

 By visiting my [personal page](https://gediminaspalsys.uk/), you will find the animation effect in action. Also I have scramble
 text effect too. By visiting [original - TextSplitter.js](https://github.com/VitaminasG/Laravel-Vue-Portfolio/blob/master/resources/js/textMaterial.js)
 you can explore not only the module itself but also how I implemented with VueJs single file components. All JS files you will
 find in the same folder.
